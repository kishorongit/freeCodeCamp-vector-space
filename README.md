Learn special methods by building a vector space.

## Introduction to Special Methods

A variety of instance methods are reserved by Python which affects the behavior of a class, especially an object's high level behavior and its interactions with operators. These are are known as special methods. The names of these methods follow a specific naming pattern that include both a leading and trailing double underscore in their names as `__<name>__`. `__init__` and `__str__` are examples of special methods. Accordingly, they can also be referred to as magic methods or "dunder" (double underscore) methods. Thery are called in specific situations such as `__init__` during instantiation and `__str__` when the object is printed or passed to `str()`.
